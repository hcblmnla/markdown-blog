# Markdown blog

## Quick-and-dirty solution

Simple REST API for blog administration:

- no attempts to fix `N+1` e.g.
- `createOrGet` simplifications

and this is also a demonstration of how REST is both simple and slow

## Async

Using `CoroutineCrudRepository` from Spring Boot Data R2DBC

## TODO

- [ ] markdown rendering (parsing to HTML)
